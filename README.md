# Music Maker

This project is an experiment to try out different kinds of deep learning models for music. The main focus for this project is to implement audio waveform models and symbolic music models, and use such models in a common context to aid in creating interesting interfaces for music making. The project consists of a backend which provides functionality to work with deep learning models for music, and an interface that lets us interact with these models using music hardware (e.g. MIDI controller) or a computer keyboard.
